<h1 id="Bitcoin-Giving-Pledge">üôèüèº Bitcoin Giving Pledge</h1>

Bitcoiners will soon be the wealthiest people in the world.<br>
      <br>
**How are we ensuring we steward this great responsibility to best do right by the most people?**<br>
<br>

- There is a CrYPtO Giving Pledge ‚Äì great. We're bitcoin-only; we're money only.
  
- The Billionaire's Giving Pledge exists... but what <s>the fuck</s> have they been doing?!

## We <s>can</s> will do better.

**21% to the cause(s) of your choice. At death‚Äîor perhaps better‚Äîduring your life.**<br>
Or maybe you want to live off 21% and dedicate your other 79%... IDK. Make it your own!<br>
      
**SEE, FEEL, AND LIVE YOUR IMPACT.**
      
It doesn't matter how much Bitcoin you have.<br>
      You don't have to be a billionaire; most of us aren't.<br>
      No worries. Percentages don't care.<br>
      You just have to have a good heart to do well in the world in some way.<br>
        <br>
      **Let's make positive differences! Ascend our Maslow's Hierarchy**<br>
