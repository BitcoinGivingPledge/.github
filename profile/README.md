"You can just zap sats." ‚ö°Ô∏è

We Bitcoiners will soon be among the wealthiest people in the world.

So how are we ensuring we steward this great responsibility to best do right by the most people?

And how are we bringing others along while doing so?

There is a CrYPtO Giving Pledge; great, convert those scam coins into at least some sort of benefit for society.

The Billionaire's Giving Pledge exists too... wonderful, more of the world's fiat wealthiest should join them.

We Bitcoiners can will do our part too.

NO MINIMUM. Anyone‚Äîeveryone‚Äîcan BTC, Be The Change.

Is it 21% of your stack to the cause(s) of your choice? 2.1%? Will you donate at death, or perhaps better, during your life? Or maybe you even opt to live off just 21% and dedicate your other 79%... IDK. Make it your own!

SEE, FEEL, AND LIVE YOUR IMPACT

It doesn't matter how much Bitcoin you have.

You don't have to be a billionaire or even a millionaire; most of us aren't.

No worries. Percentages don't care.

You just have to have a good heart to do well in the world in even some small way.

And then remember, you can just zap sats. ‚ö°Ô∏è

Let's make positive differences! Raise your bar. Ascend Maslow's Hierarchy. No contribution is too small.
