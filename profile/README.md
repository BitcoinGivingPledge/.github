<h1 id="Bitcoin-Giving-Pledge"><br>🙏🏼 Bitcoin Giving Pledge</h1>

Bitcoiners will soon be the wealthiest people in the world.<br>
      <br>
<bold>How are we ensuring we steward this great responsibility to best do right by the most people?</bold><br>

       > There is a CrYPtO Giving Pledge – great. We're bitcoin-only; we're money only.
> The Billionaire's Giving Pledge exists... but what <s>the fuck</s> have they been doing?!

      <h3>We <s>can</s> will do better.</h3>
      <strong>21% to the cause(s) of your choice. At death—or perhaps better—during your life.</strong><br>
              Or maybe you want to live off 21% and dedicate your other 79%... IDK. Make it your own!<br>
      <br>
      SEE, FEEL, AND LIVE YOUR IMPACT.<br>
It doesn't matter how much Bitcoin you have.<br>
      You don't have to be a billionaire; most of us aren't.<br>
      No worries. Percentages don't care.<br>
      You just have to have a good heart to do well in the world in some way.<br>
